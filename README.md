# Matlab_Projects
This repository contains various MATLAB codes from different disciplines in electrical engineering such as:

1- Robotics: 3DOF delta robot workspace analysis,
	     Controlling robotic car with MATLAB and Arduino,
             Using SimMechanics to simulate a humanoid. 
	     
2- High Voltage: General code for plotting Lattice Diagram of transmitting waves in transmission lines.

3- Power Flow Analysis: using two techniques (Gauss-Seidel technique, Newton-Raphson Technique).

4- Electric machines: Simulation of different types of electric motors and generators in various conditions and study cases.

5- Power Electronics: Simulation of some power electronics circuits using Simulink.
